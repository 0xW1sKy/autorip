autorip-v2
=======
Autorip-v2 is a automated dvd and bluray ripping and encoding with makemkv and ffmpeg
-------------
Pre-requisites.
- ffmpeg.exe  (I suggest downloading from here: https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ )
- MakeMKV 

-------------

To do

 - ~~FFmpeg conversion handover~~
 - ~~Disc detection~~
 - Asynchronous transcode with queue
 - ~~Nvidia GPU Transcode~~
 - Automatic file detection/rename
 - Clean up my shitty code. (I should really read a style guide one of these days.)
 - Add more error handling
 - Add -help switch
 - Find a better way to do disc drive detection
 - add no-gpu switch. (this should be fairly simple to accomplish.)
